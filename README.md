# Traffic-congestion
Agentic AI System for Explainable Traffic Congestion Analysis

An AI-powered traffic analysis system built using IBM watsonx.ai, Langflow, and explainable multi-agent workflows.

This project analyzes traffic data, identifies congestion patterns, explains underlying causes, and supports interactive user queries through transparent AI reasoning.

## Problem Statement

AI-Based Explainable Traffic Congestion Analysis System

## System Architecture

The solution uses a **modular multi-agent architecture**:

### Model 1 — Traffic Data Analysis Agent
- Analyzes traffic data and congestion indicators
- Identifies traffic patterns and abnormal conditions
### Model 2 — Congestion Cause Analysis Agent
- Determines underlying causes of traffic congestion
- Correlates congestion with factors such as time, incidents, and traffic volume

### Model 3 — Explainable Insight Generator
- Converts analytical results into human-readable explanations
- Provides transparent and interpretable insights for users

## Technology Stack
- IBM watsonx.ai
- IBM Granite Foundation Models
- Langflow (DataStax)
