#System Architecture

The Explainable Traffic Congestion Analysis System is built using a multi-stage, agentic AI pipeline implemented in Langflow and powered by IBM watsonx.ai Granite models.

##Components Overview

1.User Input Layer
Accepts traffic-related queries and congestion alerts
Collects contextual information such as location, time window, and traffic conditions

2.Traffic Data Analysis Agent
Aggregates and analyzes traffic data from multiple sources
Extracts traffic patterns, trends, and anomalies from input data

3.Congestion Cause Analysis Agent
Identifies underlying causes of traffic congestion
Correlates congestion patterns with factors such as time-of-day, incidents, weather, and traffic volume changes

4.Explainable Insight Assistant
Generates human-readable explanations of congestion causes
Converts analytical outputs into interpretable insights for traffic operators

5.Language Model Layer
Uses IBM watsonx.ai Granite models for reasoning and generation
Ensures consistent, explainable, and reliable AI outputs

##Design Principles

- Modular multi-agent architecture using Langflow
- Explainable AI for transparent congestion analysis
- Trust-centric and human-in-the-loop decision support
- Reduced hallucination through structured agent workflows
