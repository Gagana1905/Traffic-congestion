## Demo Flow

1. User enters traffic-related queries or congestion alerts
2. System analyzes incoming traffic data and patterns
3. Congestion level and affected regions are identified
4. Underlying causes of traffic congestion are analyzed
5. Explainable insights and human-readable explanations are generated
6. User asks follow-up questions for better understanding of congestion causes

This demonstrates an end-to-end agentic AI system for explainable traffic congestion analysis.
