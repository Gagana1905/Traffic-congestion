## Demo Flow

1. User submits traffic-related queries or congestion alerts via the chat interface
2. The system interprets input and retrieves relevant traffic context
3. Traffic patterns and congestion severity are analyzed
4. Specialized agents identify underlying causes and contributing factors 
5. The system generates explainable, human-readable insights grounded in data
6. Users interact with follow-up questions to deepen understanding and support decisions

This demonstrates an end-to-end agentic AI system for explainable traffic congestion analysis, built using IBM watsonx.ai and Granite foundation models.
